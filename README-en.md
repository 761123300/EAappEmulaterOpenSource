Currently only Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) and English (en-US) are supported. If you are interested in translating to other languages, please fork the code and create your language file in Assets/Files/Lang and write it according to the zh-CN.xaml standard.

By default, we will read your computer's primary language and set it as the default display language for the program.

If you have any questions about the translation, please fork the code and submit the correct translation, or submit a new issue
